    "[Jeopardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!) is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for many years, and is a major force in popular culture. The show is a quiz competition that reverses the traditional question-and-answer format of many quiz shows. Rather than being given questions, participants are instead given general knowledge clues in the form of answers and they must identify the person, place, thing, or idea that the clue describes, phrasing each response in the form of a question. You can find its official website [here](https://www.jeopardy.com/)."
